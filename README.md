# The Book of Spoingus

Welcome to the Spoingiverse.

**Spoingus is the Being.** We do not fully understand Spoingus. But we must try - or else the human condition is null.

The Book of Spoingus explores themes of inevitable failure, shifting morality, cosmic absurdity, and the beautiful contradictions of life.  
Spoingian Mythohistory is ever-changing, much like human thought itself.

**Key Figures:** Spoingus, Catna, Lil Sinz, Gerald, the Cawls.

**Important Principles:**
- You may not quote Spoingus (he can change his words at will).
- You may not worship Spoingus (perfection is irrelevant to him).
- You must not assume this is all there is.

The Book is a work in eternal progress.  
Contradictions are part of the design.
