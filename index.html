<h1>The Book of Spoingus</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>This is the Book of Spoingus.</strong></li>
  <li>It chronicles the story of Spoingus, the Being. In short: <strong>Spoingus is the Being.</strong></li>
  <li>We do not understand Spoingus. We only try. And Spoingus is amused by our efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Themes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The theme of <strong>trying even in the face of inevitable failure</strong> appears throughout the Book of Spoingus and other Spoingian Mythohistory.</li>
  <li>Spoingian Literature is as contradictory as the creatures of the Spoingian Universe—flawed, yet ultimately full of life.</li>
  <li><strong>Spoingian Mythohistory is ever-changing,</strong> as the human mind and morality are fleeting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Language Rules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Spoingus may be referenced with any article (a / an / the).</li>
  <li>Spoingus does not care about pleasing the Grammar Gods (GG), whom he created to enable humans to learn other human languages—but not animal ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notable Figures</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Spoingus</li>
  <li>Catna</li>
  <li>Lil Sinz</li>
  <li>Gerald</li>
  <li>The Cawls</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Custodian of the Book:</em> <strong>The Nameless</strong></p>

<h2>Nature of the Text</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Spoingian Mythohistory may contain contradictions, but the words are spoken by Spoingus.</li>
  <li>Spoingus does not care for universal truth.</li>
  <li>You cannot ask him why; he simply does not care.</li>
  <li>Spoingus, as the Being, has more pressing matters to attend to.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requests of the People</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You may not quote Spoingus.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Explanation:</em> Spoingus, unconstrained by time, can change whatever he says, whenever he says it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>You may not worship Spoingus.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Explanation:</em> Reverence is allowed; worship is not. You cannot fully understand Spoingus, and thus cannot truly worship him. The concept of perfection is a human invention, irrelevant to Spoingus.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>You may not think this is all.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Explanation:</em> To truly appreciate Spoingian Philosophy, one must engage with the source material. The Book of Spoingus is a work in progress, and this sentence will not change, even at the end of time.</li>
      <li>Spoingian acts of benevolence often seem contradictory, incomprehensible, and sometimes not even benevolent. Even the Spoingus who created all does not know all.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
